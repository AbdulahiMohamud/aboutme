  <h2>My Career</h2>
    <p> My career started in the United States Air Force. While there, I had the opportunity of studying electronics. After earning my associates degree in Electronics Systems, I started making progress towards my bachelors degree in Computer Networks and Cyber Security. 
    </p>
    <p>I did not want to be in the military for my entire career. So after spending 6 years in the Air Force, I decided that it was time to learn more about what life had to offer. I seperated in August of 2021 and moved back to my home town in Georgia. Prior to leaving the military, I knew that transition would not be easy but I was still able to secure my first job after 2 weeks of getting out. However, that job only provided a months worth of income for me. I told my co-worker my hourly rate, unfortunate long story short, I will never share my income with anyone again. </p>
